# Joint-Account-Savings
![Image](image.png)

This README file describes the creation of a Solidity-based joint savings contract. The contract consists of two variables, accountOne and accountTwo, which are of type address payable. Additionally, the contract includes a variable named lastWithdraw of type address public, and two variables of type uint public named lastWithdrawAmount and contractBalance.

Once the contract was deployed using the Javascript VM, deposit and withdraw functionalities were enabled, allowing users to make deposits and withdrawals from the contract and into accountOne and accountTwo
